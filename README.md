# pttbbs-web
This is the demo of web-based pttbbs using go-pttbbsweb.

# Getting Started

You can get started by visiting the following website:

[https://www.devptt.dev](https://www.devptt.dev)

The corresponding backend repository of this website is:
* [go-pttbbsweb](https://github.com/Ptt-official-app/go-pttbbsweb)
* [go-pttbbs](https://github.com/Ptt-official-app/go-pttbbs)

The architecture is based on [中台架構-站台部屬規劃(20210126版本for測試計畫)](https://hackmd.io/@twbbs/Root#%E6%9E%B6%E6%A7%8B%E5%9C%96).

## Edit and Apply Configuration

Configuration is required for running this demo.

You can refer to examples `config.test/` or `config.tmpl/` for setting up your own configuration.

Your project directory needs to have the following file layout:

* `config/` - your configuration directory (must be this name)
    * `index.js` - contains all the configuration needed by the project.
        * Ensure that `API_ROOT` has been set to the API URL of a running openbbs-middleware instance.

When done editing `index.js`, remember to copy `config/` into the directory `node_modules/`.

```sh
cp -r config node_modules/
```

## Starting server at localhost

``` sh
npm start
```

Then you should be able to access the page on localhost:3000.

# Development

## For building multiple html pages

Besides the home-page, we would like to have
several complete-independent pages,
including register, forgot-password, admin, etc.
